### How to install CoPaw

CoPaw supports multiple installation methods. See
[Quick Start](https://copaw.agentscope.io/docs/quickstart) for details:

1. One-line installer (sets up Python automatically)

```
# macOS / Linux:
curl -fsSL https://copaw.agentscope.io/install.sh | bash
# Windows (PowerShell):
irm https://copaw.agentscope.io/install.ps1 | iex
# For latest instructions, refer to docs and prefer pip if needed.
```

2. Install with pip

Python version requirement: >= 3.10, < 3.14

```
pip install copaw
```

3. Install with Docker

If Docker is installed, run the following commands and then open
`http://127.0.0.1:8088/` in your browser:

```
docker pull agentscope/copaw:latest
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8088:8088 \
  -v copaw-data:/app/working \
  -v copaw-secrets:/app/working.secret \
  agentscope/copaw:latest
```

> **⚠️ Special Notice for Windows Enterprise LTSC Users**
>
> If you are using Windows LTSC or an enterprise environment governed by strict security policies, PowerShell may run in **Constrained Language Mode**, potentially causing the following issue:
>
> 1. **If using CMD (.bat): Script executes successfully but fails to write to `Path`**
>
>    The script completes file installation. Due to **Constrained Language Mode**, it cannot automatically update environment variables. Manually configure as follows:
>
>    - **Locate the installation directory**:
>      - Check if `uv` is available: Enter `uv --version` in CMD. If a version number appears, **only configure the CoPaw path**. If you receive the prompt `'uv' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file,` configure both paths.
>      - uv path (choose one based on installation location; use if step 1 fails): Typically `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`, `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\uv`, or the `Scripts` folder within your Python installation directory
>      - CoPaw path: Typically located at `%USERPROFILE%\.copaw\bin`.
>    - **Manually add to the system's Path environment variable**:
>      - Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl` and press Enter to open System Properties.
>      - Click “Advanced” -> “Environment Variables”.
>      - Under “System variables”, locate and select `Path`, then click “Edit”.
>      - Click “New”, enter both directory paths sequentially, then click OK to save.
>
> 2. **If using PowerShell (.ps1): Script execution interrupted**
>
> Due to **Constrained Language Mode**, the script may fail to automatically download `uv`.
>
> - **Manually install uv**: Refer to the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases) to download `uv.exe` and place it in `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` or `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\uv`; or ensure Python is installed and run `python -m pip install -U uv`.
> - **Configure `uv` environment variables**: Add the `uv` directory and `%USERPROFILE%\.copaw\bin` to your system's `Path` variable.
> - **Re-run the installation**: Open a new terminal and execute the installation script again to complete the `CoPaw` installation.
> - **Configure the `CoPaw` environment variable**: Add `%USERPROFILE%\.copaw\bin` to your system's `Path` variable.

### How to update CoPaw

To update CoPaw, use the method matching your installation type:

1. If installed via one-line script, re-run the installer to upgrade.

2. If installed via pip, run:

```
pip install --upgrade copaw
```

3. If installed from source, pull the latest code and reinstall:

```
cd CoPaw
git pull origin main
pip install -e .
```

4. If using Docker, pull the latest image and restart the container:

```
docker pull agentscope/copaw:latest
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8088:8088 \
  -v copaw-data:/app/working \
  -v copaw-secrets:/app/working.secret \
  agentscope/copaw:latest
```

5. If using the Windows Desktop App (exe), currently you need to uninstall and reinstall:
   - Uninstall CoPaw from your PC
   - Download the latest version from: https://github.com/agentscope-ai/CoPaw/releases
   - Reinstall

After upgrading, restart the service with `copaw app`.

### How to initialize and start CoPaw service

Recommended quick initialization:

```bash
copaw init --defaults
```

Start service:

```bash
copaw app
```

The default Console URL is `http://127.0.0.1:8088/`. After quick init, you can
open Console and customize settings. See
[Quick Start](https://copaw.agentscope.io/docs/quickstart).

### Port 8088 conflict on Windows

On Windows, Hyper-V and WSL2 may reserve certain port ranges, which can conflict
with CoPaw's default port **8088**. This affects all installation methods
(pip, script, Docker, desktop app).

**Symptoms:**

- Error: `Address already in use` or `OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use`
- Error: `An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions`
- CoPaw fails to start, or browser cannot connect to `http://127.0.0.1:8088/`

**Check if port 8088 is reserved on Windows:**

Open PowerShell or CMD and run:

```powershell
netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp
```

If 8088 appears in the excluded ranges, it's reserved by the system.

**Solution: Use a different port**

**For pip / script installation:**

```bash
copaw app --port 8090
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8090/` in your browser.

**For Docker:**

```bash
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8090:8088 \
  -v copaw-data:/app/working \
  -v copaw-secrets:/app/working.secret \
  agentscope/copaw:latest
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8090/` in your browser.

**For Windows Desktop App:**

Currently, the desktop app uses port 8088 by default. If you encounter this
issue, you can:

1. Run `copaw app --port 8090` from a terminal instead
2. Or exclude port 8088 from Windows reserved ranges (requires administrator
   privileges and may affect other services)

**Advanced: Prevent Windows from reserving port 8088**

Run the following in an elevated PowerShell (run as Administrator):

```powershell
# Exclude port 8088 from the dynamic port range
netsh int ipv4 set dynamicport tcp start=49152 num=16384
# Restart Windows for changes to take effect
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This changes system-wide port configuration. Only do this if
> you understand the implications.

### Open-source repository

CoPaw is open source. Official repository:
`https://github.com/agentscope-ai/CoPaw`

### Where to check latest version upgrade details

See the site [Release notes](https://copaw.agentscope.io/release-notes/?lang=en)
or CoPaw GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/CoPaw/releases).

### How to configure models

In Console, go to **Settings → Models** to configure. See the
[Models](https://copaw.agentscope.io/docs/models) doc for details:

- Cloud models: enter the provider API key (e.g. ModelScope, DashScope, or a
  custom provider).
- Local models: supports `llama.cpp`, LM Studio and Ollama.

After configuration, choose the target provider and model under **Default LLM**
at the top of the Models page and **Save** — that becomes the global default.

To use a different model per agent, switch the agent with the selector at the top-left of Console, then pick a model in the top-right of the **Chat** page for that
agent.

You can also use `copaw models` for setup, downloads, and switching. See
[CLI → Models and environment variables → copaw models](https://copaw.agentscope.io/docs/cli#copaw-models).

### How to use CoPaw-Flash series models

CoPaw-Flash is a family of models tuned by the CoPaw team for CoPaw's core
usage scenarios. It comes in 2B, 4B, and 9B sizes. In addition to the original
models, each version also provides 4-bit and 8-bit quantized variants to suit
different VRAM budgets and performance needs.

CoPaw-Flash models are currently open-sourced on
[ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/organization/AgentScope?tab=model) and
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/agentscope-ai/models), and can be
downloaded directly from either platform.

All built-in local providers in CoPaw can be used with CoPaw-Flash models:

#### CoPaw Local (llama.cpp)

In the CoPaw Local model interface, simply choose a CoPaw-Flash model to
download and start it.

![Start Model](https://gw.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/O1CN01NSNFUN1I21RynZwGy_!!6000000000834-2-tps-1224-1194.png)

> CoPaw Local is still in beta. Compatibility across different devices and
> runtime stability are still being improved. If you run into issues while
> using it, please open an issue on GitHub.
> If CoPaw Local does not work properly in your environment, we recommend
> deploying CoPaw-Flash with Ollama or LM Studio first.

#### Ollama

1. Download a quantized CoPaw-Flash model from
   [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/organization/AgentScope?tab=model)
   or [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/agentscope-ai/models). These model
   variants use suffixes such as `Q8_0` or `Q4_K_M`, for example
   [CoPaw-Flash-4B-Q4_K_M](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/AgentScope/CoPaw-Flash-4B-Q4_K_M).

   - Download with ModelScope CLI:

     ```bash
     modelscope download --model AgentScope/CoPaw-Flash-4B-Q4_K_M README.md --local_dir ./dir
     ```

   - Download with Hugging Face CLI:

     ```bash
     hf download agentscope-ai/CoPaw-Flash-4B-Q4_K_M --local_dir ./dir
     ```

1. Download and install Ollama from the [official site](https://ollama.com/download),
   then start it.

1. Import the downloaded model into Ollama with the `ollama create` command:

Create a text file named `copaw-flash.txt` with the following contents. Replace
`/path/to/your/copaw-xxx.gguf` with the absolute path to the `.gguf` file in
the CoPaw-Flash model repository you downloaded:

```text
FROM /path/to/your/copaw-xxx.gguf
TEMPLATE {{ .Prompt }}
RENDERER qwen3.5
PARSER qwen3.5
PARAMETER presence_penalty 1.5
PARAMETER temperature 1
PARAMETER top_k 20
PARAMETER top_p 0.95
```

Then run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ollama create copaw-flash -f copaw-flash.txt
```

1. In CoPaw model settings, choose the Ollama provider, then automatically load
   the model on the Models page.

#### LM Studio

1. Follow step 1 in the Ollama section above to download an appropriate
   quantized CoPaw-Flash model.

1. Download and install LM Studio from the [official site](https://lmstudio.ai/),
   then start it.

1. Import the downloaded model into LM Studio with the following command:

```bash
lms import /path/to/your/copaw-xxx.gguf -c -y --user-repo AgentScope/CoPaw-Flash
```

1. In CoPaw model settings, choose the LM Studio provider, then automatically
   load the model on the Models page.

### When using models deployed with Ollama / LM Studio, why can't CoPaw complete multi-turn interactions, complex tool calls, or remember earlier instructions?

In most cases, this is not a CoPaw bug. The root cause is usually that the
model's context length is configured too small.

When you deploy a local model with Ollama or LM Studio, if the model's
`context length` is too low, CoPaw may show problems such as:

- failing to sustain multi-turn conversations reliably
- losing context during complex tool calls
- forgetting instructions given in earlier turns
- drifting away from the task during long-running interactions

**How to fix it:**

- Before running CoPaw, set the model's `context length` to **at least 32K**
- For more complex tasks, frequent tool calls, or longer conversations, you
  may need a value **higher than 32K**

> ⚠️ **Before running CoPaw, you must set the context length to 32K or higher**
>
> For local models deployed with Ollama or LM Studio, CoPaw typically needs a
> context length of **32K or higher** to handle multi-turn interactions,
> complex tool calls, and long-context tasks reliably. In more demanding
> scenarios, an even larger context window may be required.
>
> Note that larger context windows can significantly increase VRAM / memory
> usage and compute cost, so make sure your local machine can handle it.

**Ollama configuration example:**

![Ollama context length configuration](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01JrqRjE1l6FxuO3IMl_!!6000000004769-2-tps-699-656.png)

**LM Studio configuration example:**

![LM Studio context length configuration](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01LWyG6o21E4Zovqv4G_!!6000000006952-2-tps-923-618.png)

### Troubleshooting scheduled (cron) tasks

In Console, go to **Control -> Cron Jobs** to create and manage scheduled tasks.

![cron](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01duPPPB1R0x495tRdY_!!6000000002050-2-tps-3822-2064.png)

The easiest way to create a cron job is to talk to CoPaw in the channel where you want the results. For example, say: “Create a scheduled task that reminds me to drink water every five minutes.” You can then see the enabled job in Console.

If a scheduled task does not run as expected, try the following:

1. Confirm that the CoPaw service is running.

2. Check that the task **Status** is **Enabled**.

   ![enable](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01XsJiIH1bIUOD4j9sF_!!6000000003442-2-tps-3236-880.png)

3. Check that **Dispatch Channel** is set to the channel where you want the result (e.g. console, dingtalk, feishu, discord, imessage).

   ![channel](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01JN4bq61WKFpzXrIcZ_!!6000000002769-2-tps-3230-876.png)

4. Check that **Dispatch Target User ID** and **Dispatch Target Session ID** are correct.

   ![id](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN014BLaOC1YwO2onZK8U_!!6000000003123-2-tps-3236-874.png)

   In Console, go to **Control -> Sessions** and find the session you used when creating the task. To have the task reply in that session, the **User ID** and **Session ID** there must match the task’s **Dispatch Target User ID** and **Dispatch Target Session ID**.

   ![id](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01iZZhHZ1VeZnMzjlMm_!!6000000002678-2-tps-3236-1068.png)

5. If the task runs at the wrong time, check the **Schedule (Cron)** for the task.

   ![cron](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01TSodVd21msgJQvHkI_!!6000000007028-2-tps-3234-876.png)

6. To verify that the task was created and can run, click **Execute Now**. If it works, you should see the reply in the target channel. You can also ask CoPaw: “Trigger the ‘drink water reminder’ task I just created.”

   ![exec](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01MkrSYn1mJpJshAO8n_!!6000000004934-2-tps-3224-878.png)

### How to manage Skills

Go to **Agent -> Skills** in Console. You can enable/disable Skills, create
custom Skills, and import Skills from Skills Hub. See
[Skills](https://copaw.agentscope.io/docs/skills).

### How to configure MCP

Go to **Agent -> MCP** in Console. You can enable/disable/delete/create MCP
clients there. See [MCP](https://copaw.agentscope.io/docs/mcp).

### Common errors

1. Error pattern: `You didn't provide an API key`

Error detail:

```
Error: Unknown agent error: AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': "You didn't provide an API key. You need to provide your API key in an Authorization header using Bearer auth (i.e. Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY). ", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': None}, 'request_id': 'xxx'}
```

Cause 1: model API key is not configured. Get an API key and configure it in
**Console -> Settings -> Models**.

Cause 2: key is configured but still fails. In most cases, one of the
configuration fields is incorrect (for example `base_url`, `api key`, or model
name).

CoPaw supports API keys obtained via DashScope Coding Plan. If it still fails,
please check:

- whether `base_url` is correct;
- whether the API key is copied completely (no extra spaces);
- whether the model name exactly matches the provider value (case-sensitive).

### How to get support when errors occur

To speed up troubleshooting and fixes, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/CoPaw/issues) in the CoPaw GitHub
repository and attach the full error message and any error detail file.

Console errors often include a path to an error detail file. For example:

Error: Unknown agent error: AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': "You didn't provide an API key. You need to provide your API key in an Authorization header using Bearer auth (i.e. Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY). ", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': None}, 'request_id': 'xxx'}(Details: /var/folders/.../copaw_query_error_qzbx1mv1.json)

Please upload that file (e.g. `/var/folders/.../copaw_query_error_qzbx1mv1.json`)
and also provide your current model provider, model name, and CoPaw version.
