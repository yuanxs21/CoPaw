"""Detect repeated identical non-plan tool calls during plan execution.

When a subtask is ``in_progress``, the model sometimes re-runs the same
shell command or file read in a loop without calling ``finish_subtask``.
This guard blocks the Nth identical call and returns an error that routes
through the same path as :func:`check_plan_tool_gate` so the model must
advance the plan instead.
