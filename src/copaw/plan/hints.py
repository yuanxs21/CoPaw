"""Custom plan-to-hint generator for CoPaw.

Key differences from the AgentScope default:

1. **Confirmation step** -- after creating a plan the agent must
   present it and wait for user approval before execution.
2. **Seamless transitions** -- after finishing one subtask the agent
   moves to the next immediately without pausing.
3. **Compact plan text** -- completed-subtask outcomes and timestamps
   are dropped from the hint so the per-iteration context cost stays
   constant regardless of how many subtasks have finished.  This
   prevents the "overflow -> truncate -> retry -> overflow" loop that
   occurs when the plan hint grows unboundedly.
4. **Scoped ``no_plan`` hint** -- when there is no active plan yet, a
   short hint tells the model to call ``create_plan`` without
   browser/web tools first *only if* the user asked for a plan; heavy
   tooling is deferred to named subtasks after confirmation.
5. **Stall guard** -- if the same subtask stays ``in_progress`` across
   many consecutive hint generations, the hint escalates to force
   ``finish_subtask`` so the ReAct loop does not repeat the same tool
   calls until ``max_iters`` is hit.
6. **Console visibility** -- during execution, hints require short
   user-visible prose each turn (not tool-only replies) so the web
   console shows what is happening, not only tool invocations.
